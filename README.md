# bootsector-hexdump

Just a simple bootloader that you can flash to a usb drive using dd or win32diskimager, and that print the content of the memory at the current location, using BIOS calls.

To show the next chunk of 256 bytes, press any key, and to go back to the previous chunk,press 'w' (assuming you have a qwerty keyboard)
